### Introduction

> Describe the general area covered by the project.
This project will be a progressive web application that will host a location-based music recognition service.


### Outline

> Outline the proposed project.
For our project we want to create a progressive web application which will take audio input through a mobile phone and will then use an     existing API like Aud-D to identify the inputted song, record where and when the user inputted the audio into the PWA, and display  information on both the song and the artist. We also plan to implement neural network technologies to reduce any unwanted noise in the recording to improve the systems ability to identify a song playing in a noisy environment.

### Background

> Where did the ideas come from?
### We were inspired by the idea after attending a music festival. One of the project members used shazam frequently to identify different songs while at the fesitval, but when looking back over their shazam history it was difficult to remember which song was which and where and when they were played, which defeats the purpose of identifying a song. With our project, the songs identified will be accompanied by a timestamp and a location. This will make it easier for the user to remember which song is which when looking back.
### Achievements

> What functions will the project provide? Who will the users be?
### The project will be a PWA availablle for anyone to use. It will be able to identify a song, timestamp the time and place of where the song was identified, provide additional information on the artist, and store the users search history in a database for them to revisit whenever they'd like.
### Justification

> Why/when/where/how will it be useful?
### As stated, the app will be available to anybody wherever they want at any time. All they have to do is search for it in their preferred browser. 
### Programming language(s)

> List the proposed language(s) to be used.
### The languages we plan to use will be Javascript, along with some html and css.
### Programming tools / Tech stack

> Describe the compiler, database, web server, etc., and any other software tools you plan to use.
### We plan to use React to create the PWA, as well as Firebase for out database.
### Hardware

> Describe any non-standard hardware components which will be required.
### We will need a mobile phone for testing this project
### Learning Challenges

> List the main new things (technologies, languages, tools, etc) that you will have to learn.
### Neither of us have experience working with progressive web apps so this will be a new challenge for the both of us. Also, while we both have a good general knowledge of programming languages (including Python, Java, C, C++) We dont have much experience with Javascript so this woll be another challenge.
### Breakdown of work

> Clearly identify who will undertake which parts of the project.
>
> It must be clear from the explanation of this breakdown of work both that each student is responsible for
> separate, clearly-defined tasks, and that those responsibilities substantially cover all of the work required
> for the project.

#### Student 1

> *Student 1 should complete this section.*
### I will be responsible for taking care of the backend of this project, including the database and implementing the API to identify the song and record this information plus the location via GPS to a database.

#### Student 2

> *Student 2 should complete this section.*
### I will be responsible for desiging the front end of the project, including the GUI and handling all of the CSS.
